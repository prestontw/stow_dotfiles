## NixOS Lima config

My NixOS lima config based on <https://github.com/nixos-lima/nixos-lima-config-sample/tree/e452960dc46fef34435b3b14279d88a7f460156e>.
I want this config to be within my config/dotfiles directory, so I didn't fork their repo.
Inspiration and information also comes from:

### Installation

Install `lima` and `just`.
With `brew`, this would be

```sh
brew install lima just
```

Additionally, enable the VM to see specific directories by replacing `mounts` in `nixos.yaml` with paths on the host and VM.
Example:

```yaml
mounts:
  - location: "~/git/datastar-f-sharp-experiment"
    mountPoint: "/home/{{.User}}.guest/git/datastar-f-sharp-experiment"
    writable: true
  - location: "~/.dotfiles"
    mountPoint: "/home/{{.User}}.guest/.dotfiles"
    writable: false
```

### VM creation

Run

```sh
just create
just shell
```

### Differences from the sample config

- Rather than using home-manager, I rely on `stow` for a majority of my dotfile management, which is what I use in other environments.
- `just` rather than setup shell scripts for provisioning and updates
- Focuses on my user, name, and architecture rather than being more general purpose.
- Only share specific directories (none by default) rather than giving access to all of my computer.
- Packages are listed in `packages.nix` rather than being spread across `nixos-lima-config.yaml` and home manager
